# Predicting-Heart-Disease-Risk-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithm
This project employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict heart disease risk using a publicly available dataset. It focuses on data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating model performance to achieve high predictive accuracy, aiming to support early intervention and effective healthcare management.
